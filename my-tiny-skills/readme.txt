A lightweight tool to inspect enabled and disabled wp-config.php constants.

== Description ==

My Tiny Skills is a developer utility that provides a quick overview of your WordPress configuration constants. It scans your environment and displays a split-view dashboard:

*   **Left Column**: Enabled constants (e.g., `WP_DEBUG`, `DB_NAME`) with their current values.
*   **Right Column**: Disabled or undefined constants.

This tool helps developers quickly verify environment settings without needing to open `wp-config.php` or `phpinfo()`.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `my-tiny-skills` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Access the tool via **Tools > My Tiny Skills**.
